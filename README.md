# DOMSanitizer

DOMSanitizer is a client-side web application firewall (WAF) module written in JavaScript and protecting against Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks in black-box model.
 
## Security Goals

* Reducing web application attacks surface on a client-side
* DOM-based XSS attacks detection

## Description
DOMSanitizer is intended for use in WAF solutions and as any other WAF it operates in a black-box model.
If you are web application developer and you control application's data flows, then you probaly should use [DOMPurify](https://github.com/cure53/DOMPurify).
 
DOMSanitizer is based on the following components:
* [DOMPurify](https://github.com/cure53/DOMPurify)
* [Acorn parser](https://github.com/ternjs/acorn)
 
DOMSanitizer uses [DOMPurify](https://github.com/cure53/DOMPurify) sanitizer for detection dangerous HTML, MathML and SVG markup and [Acorn](https://github.com/ternjs/acorn) 
parser for heuristic finding code in data flows.
It can be used in all modern browsers where `DOMPurify` and `Acorn` must work: Safari, Opera (15+), Internet Explorer (10+), Edge, Firefox and Chrome.

## API

```js
DOMSanitizer.sanitize(dirty, {contexts: ['js', 'dom']});
```
 
## Examples

```js
// Common sanitization.
DOMSanitizer.sanitize('"};alert(1);//"')
// Returns ''

// Sanitization is a JavaScript-context.
DOMSanitizer.sanitize('"};alert(1);//"', {contexts: ['js']})
// Returns ''

// Sanitization is a DOM-context (custom DOMPurify-mode).
DOMSanitizer.sanitize('<script>alert(1)</script>', {contexts: ['dom']})
// Returns ''

// Sanitization is a attribute-based context.
DOMSanitizer.sanitize(' " onmouseover=alert(1) "', {contexts: ['attr']})
// Returns ''
```

## Contexts

DOMSanitizer supports the following contexts: `DOM`, `ATTR`, `URL`, `CALLBACK`, `JS`.
